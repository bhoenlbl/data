# lspv_location_data
These data comprise the full set of locations used for the Energy Policy journal paper entitled, Shedding light on large-scale solar impacts: an analysis of property values and proximity to photovoltaics across six U.S. states. 
The file contains data for approximately 1,600 sites (i.e., rows) of large-scale solar development in CA, CT, MA, MN, NC, and NJ. 
The fields (i.e., columns) included are Energy Information Administration ID (eia_id), state, estimated coverage area of panels in square meters (area_m2), the year the project became operational (plant_year), the x/y coordinates of an approximate project centroid (longitude & latitude), and a suite of coverages of land covers as of 2010. 
The land covers are drawn for the USGS National Land Cover Database. We provide percentage coverage among the following land cover types: open water; developed, open space; developed, low intensity; developed, medium intensity; developed, high intensity; barren land; deciduous forest; evergreen forest; mixed forest; shrub/scrub; herbaceous; hay/pasture; cultivated crops; woody wetlands; and, emergent herbaceous wetlands.
